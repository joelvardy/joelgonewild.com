<p>Last night while discussing the events of the day over a beer at the hotel we wondered what would be in store today thinking we must have seen most of the popular places by now. Igor was not about to disappoint us.</p>

<p>We first went to a town called Parishev to visit the self-settlers who were allowed the re enter the exclusion zone to live, we bought food as gift and Irgor translated for us. We spoke to a 81 year old man who has lived here since 1958, he built his house by himself, we met him as he was peeling potatoes. He had an old car which he dubbed the "911 of Ukraine" - because it was rear engined.</p>

<p>It felt weird taking photos of the self-settlers however the man lowered the barriers early on telling us all to feel welcome, and take as many photos as you wanted.</p>

<p>Our next stop was Duga 3, an over-the-horizon radar system built by the Soviets, it would often broadcast in the shortwave radio bands, as a repetitive tapping noise at 10 Hz - this caused it to be known as the "Russian Woodpecker".</p>

<p>All four of us started climbing the radar; but Connor Newton, and Ed Baxter were put off by the rickety ladder. Myself and Ed Reeves made it to six stories up - and would have both gone higher has time allowed.</p>

<p>We headed back to Prypyat to see some of the things we missed yesterday Including; the school, hospital, cinema, jail, and garage.</p>

<p>Below are photos from inside Prypyat hospital, one of the buildings with the highest levels of radiation due to the contamination brought by the first responders to the explosion.</p>

<p>At the abandoned lakeside Café there was an incredible window, it looked like stained glass, however it was in fact different coloured glass panes on their side to create an image.</p>

<p>We had lunch at the cafeteria for the NSC structure workers. Igor took us to an abandoned children's summer camp within the 10km zone before first leaving the 10km zone and then passing from the 30km zone and driving on to Kiev.</p>

<p>I asked Igor about adventurers sneaking into the zone, many do, the penalties are approximately; 200uah for the first offence, 2000uah for the second one, and prison for the third.</p>

<p>After two very busy days we were all a little tired, that evening we found the most highly rated burger place on Tripadvisor and it was indeed a good burger! Still not quite getting over how good the exchange rate is; a cocktail, burger (with fries), soft drink, and a desert for less than £10 - happy days :)</p>
