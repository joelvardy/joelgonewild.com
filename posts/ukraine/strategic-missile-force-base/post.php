<p>The best nights sleep I've had all week, just what I needed! Again I got up early to pick up breakfast for the four of us before meeting the minibus at 7am to take us to the missile base. The journey was about 4 hours hours and motorways in Ukraine aren't the smoothest so after a bumpy, hot drive we arrived at the missile base to start our tour.</p>

<p>We met our guide at the entrance to the museum and she showed us how the missiles operated and the layout of the base. We then used the tunnels to go from the entrance over to the controller bunker, where we descended ten floors to the control room itself. It was very tight and it's hard to imagine how several people would have been able to work in that area for days at a time.</p>

<p>While jumping up onto a tank (in denim shorts) I hit my shin which caused quite a worrying buildup of fluid in my leg. And writing this up some five days later it's still ver painful :/</p>

<p>Traveling back on a minibus with temperatures hitting 30Â°c was even worse than on the way there. I must admit I would advise anyone else doing this to spend a day exploring Kiev, I don't think the 8 hours of driving was worth the 2 hour tour (although it was a great experience.)</p>

<p>Earlier in the week we'd spotted a local Italian restaurant, and we headed there for our dinner before grabbing some souvenirs and getting a drink and heading back to the apartment to pack.</p>

<p>Above is the video from the trip, I made the mistake of not planning what to shoot, which ultimately led to a lack of direction in the video, but I hope you can see past that :)</p>

<p>I had a brilliant time, and I'm very glad I could experience what it's like in the Chernobyl exclusion zone. Maybe one day I will return - if I do I would love to take my quad copter.</p>
