<p>I touched down at Riga International Airport ahead of schedule despite leaving the UK 15 minutes late, disembarking the plane there was light snowfall. I walked over to the bus stop, getting a 10 journey ticket (â‚¬10.9) and got onto the #22 bus getting off just outside my hotel.</p>

<p>I enjoyed walking on crunchy snow (which wasn't imminently about to melt - as it usually is in British cities) - I was glad I'd made the choice to buy a new pair of walking boots!</p>

<p>I walked around the Old Town, taking photos was broken up by having to stow the camera and warm my fingers back up (despite wearing a pair of gloves.)</p>
