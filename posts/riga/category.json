    "description": "I decided I wanted to go somewhere for my 23rd Birthday, I booked flights and a hotel in Riga, Latvia. I didn't think any more of it until a week before the trip when I noticed the temperature was around -18Â°c.<br />I was still 50/50 on whether I would go until two days before the flight, I obviously decided to go and bought a new pair of boots and some softshell trousers to cope with the cold.",
