<p>We woke up to the sound of heavy rain.. Oh well we went out and hit the trails we could easily access from down the road.</p>

<p>It started off with heavy rain and mud, but eased as the morning went on and in the early afternoon. But by mid afternoon it was raining again so we decided to finish early.</p>

<p>We ended up at the bar we had visited on our first day, they had a presher-washer which was free for customers. We we got a hot chocolate and cleaned off the bikes (and each other.)</p>
