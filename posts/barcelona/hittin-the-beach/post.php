<p>After a busy few days in the sun, we spent the morning on lovely sandy beach, although as you can see from above the coastal breeze was certainly still there.</p>

<p>In the early afternoon we walked about 50m from the beach (at around 25°c) to the ice bar (at around -5°c) quite a temperature difference!</p>

<p>After we had warmed up from the ice bar and had something to each we headed to the Plaça del Rei, and Casa Padellàs a 15th-16th century palazzo which was moved to here stone by stone - this building houses the Barcelona City History Museum which we looked around.</p>
