<p>Soon after we set the dates for this trip, I found that there was an F1 race the weekend we were leaving. I decided that we should get tickets to the Friday practice sessions.</p>

<p>We had a few issues getting a train to the circuit, I insisted it was one train.. It wasn't :P</p>

<p>It was nice to watch F1 cars in person for the first time. My brother enjoyed the F1 so much at one point he fell asleep in the afternoon sun.</p>

<p>After the Formula1 we headed back to the airport, and a flight back to the UK.. It was a shock stepping from the plane into the grim cold night in Liverpool.</p>
