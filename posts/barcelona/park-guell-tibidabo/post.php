<p>We started the day off by heading to La Boqueria, a large public market one of my mums friends had suggested we visit, it's in the guidebooks, but I wouldn't usually visit a market. I'm glad we did..</p>

<p>Park Güell was designed by who? Yes Antoni Gaudí, the same as everything else in Barcelona ;)</p>

<p>I didn't take many photos of Park Güell because I was soaking up the atmosphere.</p>

<p>We took the funicular up Tibidabo, a 512m high mountain with spectacular views overlooking Barcelona. There is an amusement park at the top, with just looks so cool, but we enjoyed an ice cream and relaxing in the sun.</p>
