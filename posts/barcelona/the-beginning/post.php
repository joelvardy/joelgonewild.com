<p>It was an early start, leaving Sheffield at 3am to get to Liverpool with plenty of time to catch our flight.. But that didn't stop us almost missing it because we weren't paying attention to the time in the departure lounge.</p>

<p>We got a train into the city from the airport, and stowed our bags in a locker before heading to the vast Olympic stadium built for the '92 games. From there we took a cable car to Montjuïc Castle, the photo above shows some of the cacti in the gardens around Montjuïc Castle. The weather was lovely, and a coastal breeze made sure we didn't get too hot.</p>

<p>Although after a whole day in the sun, I realised that coastal breeze had made me forget to cover up / use any suncream.. So I was a little pink.2</p>

<p>In the evening we visited The Magic Fountain of Montjuïc, a spectacular display of colour, light, motion, music and water acrobatics. The fountain is in front of the equally spectacular Palau Nacional (shown below.)</p>
