## End of February and March

I arrived in Barcelona on Monday 26th February 2018. I had booked a hostel until the following Monday with the hope that I would have found somewhere to live by then.

Sure enough by the Thursday I had signed the contract and had the keys to my new house in Barcelona. Just up from the Segrada Familia.

My first weekend was quite relaxed with the highlight seeing Barcelona vs Atletico Madrid at Camp Nou. The tickets were expensive and I was sat in the sky but it was a fun experience!

My coworking space was nice and I was settling in there and at home. I attended a few talks in the evenings, the first one was ‚ÄúRemote work like a boss‚Äù - I‚Äôm already a pretty good remote worker, but it was great to meet some more people.

I had heard about Andorra but didn‚Äôt really know anything about it, but I booked a bus ticket, and a ski package for the next weekend. Realising after I‚Äôd booked it that I didn‚Äôt actually have any ski gear in this country I had to go shopping üôà

The weekend up in Andorra was fun, I did forget how uncomfortable ski boots could be but I got to explore another country.

Another techy Meetup during the week, and I decided I should probably try to stay in Barcelona the following weekend (after all I have just moved here) on the Saturday I rented a car and drove slightly up the coast to Matar√≥ and spent the morning on the beach. In the afternoon I drove to one of the IKEAs in Barcelona to get some guest bedding.

I attended another techy meetup focused around natural language processing (something I‚Äôd like to play around with in the future.) An after work drinks session organised by my coworking space. And I met up with some friends who happened to be over in Barcelona on holiday.

Knowing the end of the ski season was fast approaching I decided to spend the next weekend back in Andorra, this time there was so much fresh powder snow it was incredible!

I stayed in Mountain Hostel Tarter which is expensive by hostel standards, but had really comfortable beds, a huge jacuzzi, and I met some lovely people there :)

Although having watched [the scary ski lift video](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-georgia-accident-ski-lift/runaway-chair-lift-injures-skiers-at-georgian-resort-idUSKCN1GS206) I found myself contemplating at what point I would jump for every ski lift I got on over the weekend!

## April

I began my second month in Barcelona by once again leaving the country. [This time going to Naples!](/2018-naples/).

My brother and his partner came over to visit Thursday through Sunday. I was working during the week, meeting up with them in the evenings. But on the Saturday we went to Montserrat. It‚Äôs about an hour outside of Barcelona to the town in the valley with a choice of either cable car or mountain railway up to the monastery on the mountain.

We went up the cable car, followed by a funicular railway, and then a small hike to the top of the mountain. It was windy but the views of the valley and the monastery below were spectacular.

On the 10th April I visited Palau de la M√∫sica Catalana to see Orquesta de Guitarras de Barcelona, an orchestra of classical guitarists it was the first time I'd seen a guitar orchestra, or indeed listened to classical Spanish music.

My friend Connor came over to visit in the middle of April and we first went to PortAventura, a really nice theme park a short train journey outside of Barcelona. Just as our train was approaching the final station the carriage we were in was empty, and with spirits high we were singing Sk8er Boi (the song by Avril Lavigne) out loud, until we saw a woman sat two rows in front of us raise her head. Obviously we were too busy laughing to sing after that!

We got into the park just as it opened and immediately headed to the top of the park and managed to ride Shambala and Dragon Khan four times within an hour before the queues inevitably began to build.

We had a good time at the park, I rode Hurakan Condor (a 100m vertical drop ride) 3 times but it never got any easier! It‚Äôs terrifying being hauled up 100m in the air knowing you will soon be plummeting back to earth. On the final time they unexpectedly tilted us forwards just before dropping.

The following day I flew with Connor to [Fuerteventura](/2018-fuerteventura/) where we explored the island by car over five days.

At the end of April my friend Ed came to visit me, we travelled up to Mount Tibidabo which has a grand church as well as an ammusment park on the top and we spent a day looking around and riding some of the rides.

The following day we headed to Montjuic Castle, and the old Olympic park. Obviously as well as these trips there was a lot of catching up and drinking.
