Intro: I decided to move to Barcelona, I'm going to keep updating this post with things I've been up to while I'm here.

## Month 1

I arrived in Barcelona on Monday 26th February 2018. I had booked a hostel until the following Monday with the hope that I would have found somewhere to live by then.

Sure enough by the Thursday I had signed the contract and had the keys to my new house in Barcelona. Just up from the Segrada Familia.

My first weekend was quite relaxed with the highlight seeing Barcelona vs Atletico Madrid at Camp Nou. The tickets were expensive and I was sat in the sky but it was a fun experience!

My coworking space was nice and I was settling in there and at home. I attended a few talks in the evenings, the first one was ‚ÄúRemote work like a boss‚Äù - I‚Äôm already a pretty good remote worker, but it was great to meet some more people.

I had heard about Andorra but didn‚Äôt really know anything about it, but I booked a bus ticket, and a ski package for the next weekend. Realising after I‚Äôd booked it that I didn‚Äôt actually have any ski gear in this country I had to go shopping üôà

The weekend up in Andorra was fun, I did forget how uncomfortable ski boots could be but I got to explore another country.

Another techy Meetup during the week, and I decided I should probably try to stay in Barcelona the following weekend (after all I have just moved here) on the Saturday I rented a car and drove slightly up the coast to Matar√≥ and spent the morning on the beach. In the afternoon I drove to one of the IKEAs in Barcelona to get some guest bedding.

I attended another techy meetup focused around natural language processing (something I‚Äôd like to play around with in the future.) An after work drinks session organised by my coworking space. And I met up with some friends who happened to be over in Barcelona on holiday.

Knowing the end of the ski season was fast approaching I decided to spend the next weekend back in Andorra, this time there was so much fresh powder snow it was incredible!

I stayed in Mountain Hostel Tarter which is expensive by hostel standards, but had really comfortable beds and a huge jacuzzi!

## Month 2

I began my second month in Barcelona by once again leaving the country. [This time going to Naples!](/2018-naples/).
