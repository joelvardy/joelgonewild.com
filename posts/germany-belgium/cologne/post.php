<p>A short train ride from Düsseldorf got us to Cologne, our last stop before Belgium. We looked around the Köln Domplatte, Hohenzollernbrücke Bridge, and headed up the KölnTriangle for a view over the city.</p>

<p>Just as we had done every previous evening, we looked on Tripadvisor for somewhere to eat, we chose <strong>El Chango</strong> which as it turned out was the best decision I think we made over the course of the trip. The steaks were to die for!</p>
