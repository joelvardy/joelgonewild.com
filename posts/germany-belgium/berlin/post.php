<p>Just two days after landing at Luton after <a href="/category/morzine" title="Mountain biking in Morzine">my trip to The Alps</a>, I was back flying out from Luton en route to Berlin.</p>

<p>I almost always take my dSLR / GoPros away with me when I travel - however this wasn't one of those trips, I didn't want to spend loads of time composing photos, and didn't want to worry about leaving my dSLR in a tent. So I was relying on my Nexus 5 for photos.</p>
