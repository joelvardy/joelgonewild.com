<p>My alarm woke me from my slumber at 4am the reason for this intrusion was allowing me to take some photos before the throngs of tourists arrived around Charles Bridge.</p>

<p>After a successful photography session I headed back to the hotel and got into bed at 7am - another two hours of rest before starting the days activities.</p>

<p>We first went to the Army Museum which covered the 19th to 20th century.<br />However, en route to the river our tram was part of a minor crash with a vehicle, my first tram crash.</p>

<p>After having the thickest soup-like hot chocolate I have ever seen, we took a walk up the tower on the south side of the Charles Bridge.</p>

<p>Returning to the hotel a little before 5pm we chilled out before having a very relaxing thai massage at the hotel spa.</p>

<p>In this evening we grabbed a burger at The Tavern and visited the TV tower to whiteness some spectacular panoramic views of the city.</p>
