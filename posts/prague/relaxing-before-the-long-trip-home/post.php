<p>I tried to have a lie in until 10am however around 8am my body was well and truly awake, I decided to get some breakfast and book another massage for later that morning.</p>

<p>After I enjoyed a very relaxing massage we checked out of the hotel and proceeded to the mighty model train exhibition.</p>

<p>The rest of the day was mainly sitting in parks and taking in the nice weather before our time in Prague was through.</p>

<p>16 hours after arriving at Prague airport, we got back to Sheffield, both very tired, and in need of some shut eye.</p>
