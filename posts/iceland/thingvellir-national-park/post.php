<p>This morning we chilled out a little, went to the shop and bought some food for out last few days, then headed off to Thingvellir National Park in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Thingvellir was the site of the ancient Icelandic parliament, a beautiful area, most striking of all are the faults between the Eurasian and North American tectonic plates which scar the landscape. Mandy of these are filled with surprisingly clear, blue water.</p>

<p>The beautiful area of water shown below is where Women were drowned after being convicted of either incest or prostitution, depending on what account you read.</p>
