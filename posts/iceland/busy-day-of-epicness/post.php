<p>It's been a very long day, we left our cabin at 04:30 yesterday heading to Skaftafell National Park where we took part in a guided glacier walk, our guide, Dan, was a very charismatic guy, who after allowing us to get used to walking in crampons, took us up part of the glacier. After two hours we headed back to the base camp, squeezing in a small abseil down part of the icepack.</p>

<p>We then headed to the Black Sand Beach where we climbed around, and even jumped off, some basalt columns, after which we walked along the beach taking in the awesome power of the waves.</p>

<p>From there we walked (a long, boring, 4km each way, walk) to the abandoned DC3 which crash landed slightly further down the Black Sand Beach, on the South coast of Iceland.</p>
