<p>After the <a href="/iceland/busy-day-of-epicness" title="Busy day of Epicness">busy day yesterday</a>, today was a refreshing, and relaxing day at the Blue Lagoon. The lagoon is not natural, and is caused by surplus mineral-rich water from the neighboring geothermal power plant.</p>

<p>We started out in the lagoon, having a walk / swim around, moving between areas of hot and cooler water. After getting a cold beer, and applying a face mask, we took some more silly photos and headed over to the sauna / steam room.</p>

<p>Following our relaxing time in the pool we ate an outstanding three-course meal at the <strong>LAVA Restaurant</strong> within the complex.</p>

<p>After arriving back at the cabin, we had some birthday Bollinger for Tanyas birthday and planned tomorrows activities&hellip;</p>
